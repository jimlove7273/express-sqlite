# Express SQLite

This github shows an example of using local SQLite file (db.sqlite) to perform CRUD operations for any front-end langauge.

Once cloned, you can change the name of database file used in sqlite.js.  This file also creates two users when initialized which is optional.

In server.js, you can change the port it uses.  It is currently setup to use PORT 5000.  This is also the file where all the CRUD operations are setup, including Add an user, Update an user, Delete an user, and Get all users or a single user.

This is meant to be a starting point of how you want to use this repo but the main purpose of this repo is to show how to use SQLite with ExpressJS.

Have Fun computing...
